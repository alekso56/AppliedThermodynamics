This is the Current Website (and github) for the Upcoming mod, Applied Thermodynamics.

Currently the mod is IN OPEN ALPHA!

That means it is availdable for download, But is not feature complete nor is it fully Stable.

Quick notice, Issue reports either go on the issue tracker here on github, Or Directly to me by
talking to me on #AppliedThermodynamics @ irc.esper.net

If i am not connected, Write this:

/memoserv SEND tgame14 blabalbalblala

Modpacks: Read the license. But in short, you need my written permission for any kind of modpacks
other than private ones (Where they are only distributed between a closed and small Community) that ofcourse is ok.

The one Exception for private modpacks is if you use AsieLauncher. Anyone using that on your server. You need to ask
For my permission. Doing otherwise will mean you are breaking the license!


Downloads!
==================
For More Official Releases:

Using the official Releases right now is outdated, I recommend if you do want to try it out, use the jenkins build

Explanation
==================
AT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a mod that adds Heat to ME Networks, the bigger and more power hungry the network is, the faster it heats up,
the hotter the network gets, more and more bad effects happen, from particles and sounds to the Melting of your network into Liquid ME.

there is LOTS more Coming, Not only Heat! Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/tgame14/AppliedThermodynamics/wiki) for more information

More and More. (I am Taking Suggestions freely, as far as its a Solid suggestion and logical i may add it)

As for suggestions and comments about my code and more ideas, visit #AppliedEnergistics @ irc.esper.net which is where
i usually am when i work on AT.

My hope for release is 1.7 for AE2. no promises at all (non Dev Release - Right now its open beta, See downloads above).

a few words about the license:

I can not enforce anyone to follow this license. i do not have any sort of legal power Over you in that regard.
if you do not follow the license, i will not come down to hunt you. i will though in the case of public modpacks,
Expect for atleast that. the license is here because I expect the user of this mod to respect my mod and
follow my rules, which simply imply i have rights over my own work and i may do with it as i wish.

Notice
=========
I Seem to be Flamed a lot about this mod, so i want to clarify something.

AT (Applied Thermodynamics) is a Mod that Adds a new Balancing point to AE (Applied Energistics).
This new balancing point Is meant to Be challanging to the player. it is how I think Hardcore AE should be like.
If you dont like the idea and the implementation, I understand you completely. But Do not show disrespect of 
the way i feel and want this mod to be. Dont like it - Dont Play it. But Never just go off Judging it with no
real facts to back you up. Also dont judge the mod until i announce a version where it is out of Dev. the mod is
incomplete and Thus not even nearing a fully game Experience, if you dont understand that. Do not Expect me to
show much respect to you and whatever you are Flaming about. Otherwise if you Feel like some things could Be Added
Or changed for a better Experience i urge you to tell me, Another thing is that EVERYTHING is Configurable.
EVEN HEAT ITSELF! you can turn off heat and only enjoy the non heat related features i supply. That ofcourse
will mean you miss the point of the mod, But if you want that possibility, its there.
If i missed Something to be configurable. Let me know.

I try to Be as understanding and Explanatory as possible. Show me the respect of being the same way.

Compiling
=========

Compiling Applied Thermodynamics is Very simple:

1) Clone this git repo

2) open a CMD with the path to the git repo location

3) type into CMD line "gradlew setupCIWorkspace build --stacktrace"

5) Done, look in build/libs for your compiled files, this will include reobf, deobf, api, javadoc

DONE! this is Everything you need to know with compiling, Its done this way with gradle Build scripts.

I DO NOT SUPPORT SELF COMPILED BUILDS OR UNOFFICIAL BUILDS. if you want my support, Use the builds i supply
either through jenkins or through the releases supplied Above.



Thank You!
